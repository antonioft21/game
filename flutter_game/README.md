A simple Flutter game that tests your reaction time. The project demonstrates the use of the BLoC pattern.

## Running

flutter run
```

## Gameplay

Press **Start** and wait until the screen turns green, then tap as quickly as possible. Your reaction time is displayed and stored as a high score if it's your best so far.
