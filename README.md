# Game Repository

This repository contains a simple Flutter project demonstrating a reaction time game built with BLoC.

The game source code lives under the `flutter_game` directory. To run the project locally, ensure you have Flutter installed and execute:

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

The application measures how quickly you tap the screen once it turns green. It uses the `flutter_bloc` package to manage game state.
